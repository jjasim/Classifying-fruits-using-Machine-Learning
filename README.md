# Classifying fruits
While I was delving into various classification problems, I came across this interesting read: https://medium.com/@ocktavia/fruits-lovers-solving-a-simple-classification-problem-with-python-e63ae067422c

Essentially the problem statement was this:
> Can we train a classifier to distinguish between Apples, Lemons, Oranges and Mandarin oranges?

## Preparing the Data

A brief description of the data:

The dataset has 7 features, of which I believe the mass, width, height and colour_score will be important in identifying the fruit_name.
